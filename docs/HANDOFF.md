Status: iteration 3 Telegram connect flow complete

Completed in this step:
1. Chosen runtime: Node.js local-agent skeleton with Windows-first path layout.
2. Added config/model normalization and bundled default remote config asset.
3. Added remote config loader with `remote -> cache -> default` fallback.
4. Added file/stdout logging setup with payload/content redaction safeguards.
5. Verified locally with `npm test` and `npm start`.
6. Added a local SOCKS5 listener with `NO AUTH` + `CONNECT` support.
7. Added a narrow direct transport boundary without routing data-plane through our server.
8. Verified SOCKS5 integration tests and smoke startup/shutdown on loopback.
9. Added Telegram Desktop connect flow with `tg://socks` deep link generation and platform launch fallback.
10. Moved console logs to `stderr` so `connect-url` stays script-friendly on `stdout`.

Next implementation slice:
1. Start wiring a Windows packaging path around the local agent entrypoint.
2. Add a minimal Windows-first wrapper entry that runs `connect` as the primary user path.
3. Decide whether the next transport slice stays direct-only or introduces a configurable upstream proxy target.
